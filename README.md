# Proof-of-Loyalty

Tooling for DAOs and other web3 communities using airdrops of ERC20 tokens to bootstrap community growth and loyalty.

## Problems solved
- Dumping of community tokens by airdrop hunters => real-time streaming of token airdrop instead of lump sum distribution
- Attracting unloyal airdop hunters into community => chainlink keepers checks whether users are still followers at random intervals, UMA oracle verifies that accounts following are true humans
